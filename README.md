# Guess-the-number
Developed a fully functional console-based number guessing game in Java using object-oriented programming principles.

Implemented user interaction using the Scanner class and generated random numbers with the Random class.

Used encapsulation to manage game logic in a separate class and tracked the number of attempts for each game session.

Practiced control flow, input validation, and loop handling within a real-world game scenario.

Improved code readability and maintainability by separating concerns between UI and game logic.
